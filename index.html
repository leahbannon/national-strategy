<div class="span9"><h2 id="letter">Letter from the President</h2>

<P>As President, I have no greater responsibility than ensuring the safety and security of the 
United States and the American people. Meeting this responsibility requires the closest possible 
cooperation among our intelligence, military, diplomatic, homeland security, law enforcement, 
and public health communities, as well as with our partners at the State and local level and 
in the private sector. This cooperation, in turn, demands the timely and effective sharing of 
intelligence and information about threats to our Nation with those who need it, from the 
President to the police officer on the street.</p>
<p>Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have seen great improvement in information 
sharing. Today, our analysts, investigators, and public safety professionals are sharing more 
information and cooperating more effectively than ever before. Unfortunately, we also have 
had instances when critical information was not shared quickly or widely enough, or when 
unauthorized disclosures of classified and sensitive information damaged our national security.</p>
<p>This National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (Strategy) aims to strike the 
proper balance between sharing information with those who need it to keep our country safe 
and safeguarding it from those who would do us harm. While these two priorities—sharing and 
safeguarding—are often seen as mutually exclusive, in reality they are mutually reinforcing. 
This Strategy, therefore, emphasizes how strengthening the protection of classified and sensitive 
information can help to build confidence and trust so that such information can be shared with 
authorized users. </p>
<p>This Strategy recognizes this vital information for what it is&mdash;a national asset that must be 
both protected and shared, as appropriate. The threats to our national security are constantly 
evolving, so our policies to ensure this information is used and protected as intended must evolve 
as well. This includes protecting private and personal information about United States persons 
and upholding our commitment to transparency. This Strategy makes it clear that the individual 
privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of United States persons must be&mdash;and will be&mdash;protected.</p>
<p>Our national security depends on sharing the right information with the right people at the right 
time. We will therefore keep working to maintain an environment in which information is shared 
in a manner that is responsible, seamless, and secure. Guided by this Strategy, we will continue 
to leverage critical information to keep our Nation secure and our fellow citizens safe.
</P>
<p>&ndash; President Barack Obama</p>
<h3 id="executive_summary">Executive Summary</h3>

<p>Our national security depends on our ability to share the right information, with the right people, at 
the right time This information sharing mandate requires sustained and responsible collaboration 
between Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and foreign partners Over the last few 
years, we have successfully streamlined policies and processes, overcome cultural barriers, and better 
integrated information systems to enable information sharing Today’s dynamic operating environment, however, challenges us to continue improving information sharing and safeguarding processes 
and capabilities While innovation has enhanced our ability to share, increased sharing has created the 
potential for vulnerabilities requiring strengthened safeguarding practices The 2012 National Strategy 
for Information Sharing and Safeguarding provides guidance for effective development, integration, and 
implementation of policies, processes, standards, and technologies to promote secure and responsible 
information sharing.</p>
<p>Our responses to these challenges must be strategic and grounded in three core principles First, in 
treating Information as a National Asset, we recognize departments and agencies have achieved an 
unprecedented ability to gather, store, and use information consistent with their missions and applicable 
legal authorities; correspondingly they have an obligation to make that information available to support national security missions Second, our approach recognizes Information Sharing and Safeguarding 
Requires Shared Risk Management. In order to build and sustain the trust required to share with one 
another, we must work together to identify and collectively reduce risk, rather than avoiding information 
loss by not sharing at all Third, the core premise Information Informs Decisionmaking underlies all our 
actions and reminds us better decisionmaking is the purpose of sharing information in the first place 
The Strategy focuses on achieving five goals:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Drive Collective Action through Collaboration and Accountability.</strong>We can best reach our 
shared vision when working together, using governance models that enable mission achievement, adopting common processes where possible to build trust, simplifying the information 
sharing agreement development process, and supporting efforts through performance management, training, and incentives</p>
    </li>
   <li>
       <p><strong>Improve Information Discovery and Access through Common Standards.</strong> Improving 
discovery and access involves developing clear policies for making information available to 
approved individuals Secure discovery and access relies on identity, authentication, and authorization controls, data tagging, enterprise-wide data correlation, common information sharing 
standards, and a rigorous process to certify and validate their use.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
       <p><strong>Optimize Mission Effectiveness through Shared Services and Interoperability.</strong> Efforts to 
optimize mission effectiveness include shared services, data and network interoperability, and 
increased efficiency in acquisition.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
       <p><strong>Strengthen Information Safeguarding through Structural Reform, Policy, and Technical 
Solutions.</strong>To foster trust and safeguard our information, policies and coordinating bodies must 
focus on identifying, preventing, and mitigating insider threats and external intrusions, while departments and agencies work to enhance capabilities for data-level controls, automated 
monitoring, and cross-classification solutions.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
       <p><strong>Protect Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties through Consistency and Compliance.</strong> 
Integral to maintaining the public trust is increasing the consistency by which we apply privacy, 
civil rights, and civil liberties protections across the government, building corresponding safeguards into the development of information sharing operations, and promoting accountability 
and compliance mechanisms.</p>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>As we execute the Strategy together, we will harness our collective resolve to treat information as a 
national asset, make it discoverable and retrievable by all authorized users, and arm those charged 
with preserving the security of our Nation Only as we work together, hold ourselves accountable, and 
take concerted ownership of advancing our goals, will we achieve the safety and success our country 
rightfully demands and fully deserves.</p>

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
<p class="quote"><em>To prevent acts of terrorism on American soil, we must enlist all of our intelligence, law 
enforcement, and homeland security capabilities. We will continue to integrate and leverage 
state and major urban area fusion centers that have the capability to share classified 
information; establish a nationwide framework for reporting suspicious activity; and 
implement an integrated approach to our counterterrorism information systems to ensure 
that the analysts, agents, and officers who protect us have access to all relevant intelligence 
throughout the government. We are improving information sharing and cooperation by 
linking networks to facilitate Federal, state, and local capabilities to seamlessly exchange 
messages and information, conduct searches, and collaborate.</em>
    <br/>&ndash; National Security Strategy, May 2010
</p>

<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>Anchored on the 2010 National Security Strategy, the 2012 National Strategy for Information Sharing and 
Safeguarding(hereafter referred to as the Strategy) provides guidance for more effective integration and 
implementation of policies, processes, standards, and technologies to promote secure and responsible 
national security information sharing.</p>
<p>The Strategy does not define particular categories or types of information that must be shared Rather, 
it shifts the focus of information sharing and safeguarding policy to defining information requirements 
that support effective decisionmaking The Strategy outlines a vision with a national policy roadmap 
to guide information sharing and safeguarding within existing law and policy This Strategy does not 
replace the National Strategy for Information Sharing (2007 NSIS), as the 2007 NSIS continues to provide 
a policy framework and directs many core initiatives intended to improve information sharing This 
Strategy will continue to highlight appropriate protection of individual rights&mdash;privacy and civil liberties 
are most relevant in this context Nonetheless, departments and agencies must never lose sight of their 
responsibility to protect the civil rights of all Americans in accordance with their respective authorities.</p> 

<h4>Vision</h4>

<p>It is a national priority to efficiently, effectively, and appropriately share and safeguard information so 
any authorized individual (Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector or foreign partner) can 
prevent harm to the American people and protect national security The Strategy points toward a future in which information supports national security decisionmaking by providing the right information, at 
any time, to any authorized user, restricted only by law or policy, not technology; and where safeguarding 
measures, to include a comprehensive regimen of accountability, prevent the misuse of the information.</p>

<h4>Building on Success</h4>
<p>While the 2012 Strategy establishes goals for the future, the 2007 NSIScontinues to provide the policy 
framework for institutionalizing requirements of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act 
of 2004, specifically to improve integration and responsible information sharing related to terrorism, 
homeland security, and weapons of mass destruction The 2007 NSIS also highlights the importance of 
gathering and reporting locally generated information while emphasizing two-way flows of timely and 
actionable information among government, public, and private entities To date, the concerted efforts 
of these partners have resulted in significant progress.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Established a National Network of Fusion Centers owned and managed by state and local 
entities, which use the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative (NSI) to share 
terrorism information among all levels of government; and with consistent policies to protect 
individual privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties There have been increasing levels of collaboration among the fusion centers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Joint Terrorism 
Task Forces, Field and Regional Intelligence Groups, Federal, state, and local law enforcement 
agencies, High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area programs, Regional Information Sharing System 
centers, intelligence and crime analysis units, and via initiatives like the Fusion Liaison Officer 
Program, which includes tribal and non-law enforcement partners.</li>
<li>Adopted the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM), a successful example of a common 
way to structure data exchanges to better enable information sharing NIEM is now used by 
many Federal agencies, State governments, private sector organizations, and foreign partners 
As a side benefit, NIEM promotes information technology (IT) industry adoption as a result of 
partnering with standards development organizations (SDOs).</li>
<li>Established a plan to unify and align user identification and authentication on systems, through 
the Federal Identity Credential and Access Management (FICAM) framework under the National 
Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace This represents a critical step toward establishing 
individual accountability and facilitating the appropriate level of information access.</li>
<li>Provided access to multiple data repositories across departments and agencies, consistent with 
mission authorities and legal protections For example, analysts at the National Counterterrorism 
Center (NCTC) now have access to over 30 Federal networks containing terrorism information 
This profoundly contrasts the pre-9/11 environment characterized by agency-centric data 
repositories.</li>
<li>Developed a single authoritative database of known or suspected international terrorist identities at NCTC Pertinent information from NCTC’s database now can be exported to the FBI’s 
Terrorist Screening Center database, which also includes domestic known or reasonably suspected terrorist identities, a marked improvement to the previous multiple, non-integrated lists.</li>
<li>Enhanced communications to facilitate dialogue between departments and agencies and with 
other partners For example, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), augmented 
by the Interagency Threat Assessment and Coordination Group, hold classified video teleconferences three times a day, 365 days a year, with over a dozen Federal counterterrorism entities 
Products of these efforts are available, as appropriate, to non-Federal partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these foundational efforts, we have successfully begun to streamline policies and processes, 
overcome cultural barriers, improve IT system interoperability, and enable pertinent information sharing.</p>

<h3>II. The operating Environment</h3>
<p>Ongoing advances in information technology challenge stakeholders to identify and implement 
information management best practices While innovation allows information to move unimpeded 
across jurisdictional, functional, and organizational boundaries, increased information sharing may 
create vulnerabilities that expose us to compromise, exploitation, manipulation, and unauthorized use 
of that information These issues often point to challenges in governance, information management, 
and resourcing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threats to national security remain diverse.</strong> Terrorist attacks on the homeland and U S interests abroad; insider threats to information systems; nuclear proliferation; cyber attacks; global 
economic pressures; and regional instabilities are a few examples of the diverse threats we 
face Future threats will only continue to evolve as our adversaries learn to counter our security 
measures This wide-ranging and dynamic array of challenges illustrates the range of need for 
timely and effective information sharing and safeguarding.</li>
<li><strong>Unaligned management practices and policies present obstacles.</strong> Departments and agencies need to recognize their statutory responsibilities for sharing and safeguarding information, 
overcome historically insular practices and policies, embrace a government-wide perspective, 
and agree to participate in structured collaboration Better coordinated management frameworks will provide a mechanism for creating policies and processes that enable responsible 
information sharing and safeguarding in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</li>
<li><strong>Quality control of shared information is a challenge.</strong> Information to support national security 
may be incomplete, vague, or inaccurate Building tools and techniques that help stakeholders 
to assess the provenance of information when acquired, accessed, retained, reproduced, used, 
managed, shared, and safeguarded is essential for ensuring quality control.</li>
<li><strong>Valid constraints on sharing information exist.</strong> There will always be some restrictions on 
sharing sensitive operational, law enforcement, or personally identifiable information  In addition, foreign partners, State governments, and the private sector may impose limits on use or 
dissemination of their information Efforts that respect these realities and provide a responsible 
means to share information, such as “tagging” data, identifying and authenticating users, and 
securing networks, are critical to appropriately protecting this information.</li>
<li><strong>A lack of network interoperability creates barriers across departments and agencies and 
missions.</strong> Differences in policies and technologies prevent authorized users from gaining access 
to critical resources and information on disparate networks Efforts are underway to enable
interoperability for users accessing information within “sensitive but unclassified” and classified 
networks, while maintaining high levels of protection for that information.</li>
<li><strong>Increased information sharing demands advanced correlation and analytic capabilities.</strong> Turning an abundance of data into actionable information or intelligence remains an enduring problem Many initiatives are underway, however, to enable information correlation with 
advanced analytics, including new tools, techniques, and training.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency is a necessity.</strong> The economic downturn of the past several years has affected everyone, including households, businesses, and governments Mission objectives must be met with 
innovation and agility in an extremely austere budget environment.</li>
<li><strong>Improperly safeguarded information is a liability.</strong> Our ability to properly protect information as it is shared is directly related to the maturity of governance processes, access controls, 
identity management, enterprise audit capabilities, and network interoperability efforts This 
takes us from controlling quality and access within individual networks and systems to sharing 
information management across stakeholders.</li>

<h3>III.Principles</h3>
<p class="quote"><em>The ideas, values, energy, creativity, and resilience of our citizens are America’s greatest 
resource. We will support the development of prepared, vigilant, and engaged communities 
and underscore that our citizens are the heart of a resilient country. And we must tap 
the ingenuity outside government through strategic partnerships with the private sector, 
nongovernmental organizations, foundations, and community-based organizations. 
Such partnerships are critical to U.S. success at home and abroad, and we will support 
them through enhanced opportunities for engagement, coordination, transparency, and 
information sharing.</em><br/>
&mdash; National Security Strategy, May 2010</p>

<p>To accomplish the Strategy’s vision, efforts are grounded in three core principles.</p>

<h4>1. Information is a National Asset</h4>

<p>Departments and agencies have achieved an unprecedented ability to gather, store, and use information 
consistent with their missions and applicable legal authorities They have corresponding obligations 
to make information available to any agency, department, or partner with a relevant national security 
mission and to manage that information in a manner that is lawful and protects individual rights This 
requires a continued maturation of information security, access, and safeguarding policies and processes.</p>

<p>For example, building an enterprise-wide approach moves stakeholders away from agency-specific 
networks and applications and provides secure and authorized access to information in ways that allow 
information sharing across departments and agencies.</p>

<p>Managing information as a national asset simultaneously demands stakeholders make it available to 
those who need it, while also keeping it secure from unauthorized or unintended use While originators 
are accountable for the accuracy, characterization, and availability of shared information, consumers 
who use it for reporting or decision making equally share responsibility and accountability for its manner of use In short, information collected, analyzed, and disseminated by every stakeholder must be 
discoverable and retrievable, consistent with necessary legal restrictions, and guided by governmentwide policies, standards, and management frameworks.</p>

<h4>2. Information Sharing and Safeguarding Requires Shared Risk Management</h4>
<p>Building trust in sharing and safeguarding requires the ability to manage rather than avoid risk Risk to 
national security increases when the approach to sharing is inconsistent, fragmented, or managed from a 
single-agency perspective Risk decreases, however, with sound policies and standards, increased awareness and comprehensive training, effective governance, and enhanced accountability Performance 
management and compliance monitoring at the enterprise level will aid governance, inform decisions, 
and help foster a culture that emphasizes the importance of responsible sharing.</p>

<p>Sharing and safeguarding are not mutually exclusive Policies, practices, and methods for information 
sharing and safeguarding can enable appropriate confidentiality while increasing transparency To 
realize the benefits of sharing information, stakeholders mitigate and manage risk by taking appropriate measures to build trust in the processes that safeguard information from compromise As the 
mission imperative for sharing increases, so too does the need to improve interoperable safeguarding 
techniques.</p>

<h4>3. Information Informs Decisionmaking</h4>
<p>Informed decisionmaking requires the ability to discover, retrieve, and use accurate, relevant, timely, and 
actionable information Likewise, our national security depends upon an ability to make information 
easily accessible to Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and foreign partners in a trusted 
manner, given the appropriate mission context The objective is to increase the usefulness of information in operations through the consistent application of policies, guidelines, exchange standards, and 
common frameworks, while always respecting privacy and individual rights.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the value of responsible information sharing is measured by its contribution to proactive 
decision making The above principles and below goals will help us achieve an environment wherein 
decisions are driven by information that reflects our best assessments at every level—from frontline 
personnel to agency heads.</p>


<h3>IV. Goals</h3>
<h4>1. Drive Collective Action through Collaboration and Accountability</h4>

<h5>1.1 Improve Governance to Promote Collaboration</h5>
<p>Governance plays a critical role in setting priorities and driving decisions The bodies charged with these 
responsibilities, along with performance and compliance monitoring, exist at all echelons of government Enabling their work demands clear, harmonized, and complementary charters that support collaboration and policy enforcement at the lowest possible level, yet still allow elevation of issues through 
the White House policy process An effective governance structure accounts for the complexities of a 
diverse range of missions, acknowledges resource realities, reduces gaps, minimizes redundancies, and 
aligns stakeholder policy development and implementation.</p>

<h5>1.2 Increase the Use of Common Processes</h5>
<p>Many communities use common processes for acquiring, accessing, retaining, producing, using, 
managing, sharing, and safeguarding information The SAR process used by the National Network of 
Fusion Centers and local law enforcement entities, for example, includes stakeholder outreach, privacy 
protections, training, and enabling technology to identify and report suspicious activity in jurisdictions across the country, and serves as the unified focal point for sharing SAR information Common 
processes, like SAR, provide organizations a template for repeatable, interoperable, and trusted protocols Standardization, with built-in flexibility for evolving mission requirements, also improves timely 
information discovery, access, and exchange and makes it easier to integrate new partners into existing 
information flows Not only does increasing the use of common processes provide opportunities to 
strengthen privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, it enables the implementation of vetted measures to 
safeguard information.</p>

<h5>1.3 Streamline the Development of Information Sharing Agreements</h5>
<p>Information sharing to protect national security relies on availability of information from many government agencies, the private sector, and foreign partners, all of which have diverse missions and information collection and dissemination policies As a result, developing interagency information sharing 
agreements is often a critical step in the success of cross-agency collaboration Unfortunately, this step 
is often protracted as agencies attempt to determine mutually agreeable requirements and restrictions 
related to information access, handling, and use based on differing missions, requirements, restrictions, 
and authorities Creating a template, based on common legal and policy compliance requirements 
would streamline the process, facilitate issue resolution, and enhance partnerships with private sector 
and foreign partners.</p>

<h5>1.4 Encourage Progress through Performance Management, Training, and Incentives</h5>
<p>Achieving the goals of this Strategy requires a management approach that includes incentives for 
performance at both the organizational and individual levels Departments and agencies benefit from integrating their performance management approaches to support a holistic view of progress towards 
achieving information sharing and safeguarding goals Stakeholders should not only measure improvements in information sharing and safeguarding processes (e g , discoverability, timeliness, accuracy, 
compliance, and oversight), but also measure their overall effectiveness (e g , how shared information 
helps to achieve the mission) Performance management and metrics, when paired with effective leadership, reinforces progress and motivates personnel to meet high expectations and professional standards 
Investing in staff through training and incentives also helps foster a culture that values information 
sharing and safeguarding, extending to organizations beyond our immediate communities.</p>

<h4>2. Improve Information Discovery and Access through Common Standards</h4>

<h5>2.1 Develop Clear Policies for Discovery and Access</h5>
<p>A central intent of information sharing is to make certain information is both discoverable and accessible by those with a legitimate need, in a timely manner Discovery and access are distinct concepts: 
the first addresses a user’s ability to identify the existence of information, and the second relates to a 
user’s ability to retrieve it Our national security demands relevant information is made discoverable, 
in accordance with existing laws and policies, to appropriate personnel Discovery and access require 
clear and consistent policy and standards, as well as technical guidance for implementing interoperable 
processes and technology.</p>

<h5>2.2 Improve Identity, Authentication, and Authorization Controls</h5>
<p>Information discovery requires a standardized approach to authentication so participating entities 
can validate and trust the identities of users attempting to log into their systems Information holders 
have often created their own authentication services resulting in users requiring unique credentials 
for accessing different systems or networks Using trusted, interoperable authentication services will 
minimize the number of required credentials, drive out unnecessary anonymity, and achieve efficiencies 
by eliminating stand-alone authentication services.</p>

<p>Once user identities are authenticated, their unique attributes assist in determining if access to information is authorized Both information originators and consumers share responsibility for using standard 
processes, attributes, and “rules of use” to support authentication and authorization decisions Further, 
user attributes require dynamic management to inform these decisions, including provisions for agile 
updates and removal of user access Greater policy and technical alignment across departments and 
agencies will enable implementation of interoperable capabilities that engender confidence and trust in 
the process of confirming appropriate users while also providing access to mission-relevant information.</p>

<h5>2.3 Promote Data-Level Tagging</h5>
<p>Most information authorization models are limited to access controls defined and enforced at the 
network or application-level, rather than at the data-level using inherent characteristics of specific 
information resources As networks are consolidated and shared services are adopted, access controls 
must be applied on the data itself, using “tags ” Information tagging is an approach where standard attributes—tags—are attached to a piece of information to describe it While manual discovery and access capabilities benefit from information tagging by guiding users directly to specific information based on 
their profile, it also can enable automated enforcement of access decisions based on mission-relevance 
By matching the user attributes with corresponding information attributes, the automated delivery of 
mission-specific information is improved along with the security and protection of that information from 
inappropriate recipients Information tagging further assists in meeting records management requirements, responding to disclosure inquiries, integrating privacy protections, and remediating erroneous 
data disclosures and modifications.</p>

<h5>2.4 Enhance Enterprise-Wide Data Correlation</h5>
<p>Connecting related information from disparate department and agency databases can mean the difference between identifying a threat during the planning stage or analyzing what could have been done 
to thwart the attack after it occurs Data correlation and advanced analytics, coupled with integrated 
sharing and safeguarding protections, will enable users to reference authoritative, up-to-date information across multiple agency holdings This capability can support analysts’ efforts to identify relationships among people, places, things, and characteristics that are otherwise not apparent To advance 
this capability while taking into account increasing volumes of information, stakeholders need to make 
their information accessible so an analyst can create a single query to search across many information 
sources Analysts also need automated capabilities to establish linkages across holdings and generate 
alerts when mission-relevant information becomes available While current technologies require centralized information repositories, which may yet remain appropriate in some limited cases, a decentralized 
approach allows the originator to maintain and update information as needed This promises increased 
speed in sharing and higher levels of information fidelity Successful data correlation also requires a 
validation component to determine the veracity and applicability of information before action.</p>

<h5>2.5 Drive the Use of Information Sharing Standards</h5>
<p>Meeting the mission need for enterprise-wide discovery and access warrants the use of standards By 
reusing existing standards, stakeholders can benefit from the time, resources, and experience invested 
by others to fully vet and implement a new standard As a result, capabilities to meet mission needs 
can be more rapidly, efficiently, and effectively applied without developing ad-hoc custom solutions 
or unique standards for single use Prudent information sharing leverages the use of voluntary consensus standards, as described in existing Federal policy, wherein government uses standards created 
by established SDOs, which often incorporate government, industry, and international membership 
With this approach, we first aim to adopt existing standards to meet mission needs, and when none are 
available, use SDOs to address the gap.</p>

<h5>2.6 Support Enterprise-Wide Certification and Conformance</h5>
<p>Given the abundance of standards available throughout the government, the private sector, and the 
international community, decisionmakers and users are faced with the challenge of determining which 
standard is most appropriate to satisfy their requirements while also supporting interoperability with 
other partners Consequently, there is a need for a process to validate, certify, and require the interoperability of technology solutions used to share and safeguard information This, in turn, will help inform decisionmakers of the most appropriate standards to employ while also sending a clear signal to industry 
which standards to use in developing tools and products that advance interoperability and support a 
broader set of mission needs.</p>

<h4>3. Optimize Mission Effectiveness through Shared Services and Interoperability</h4>

<h5>3.1 Share Services that Benefit All Partners</h5>
<p>Across the government, departments and agencies have begun to embrace a shared computing model, 
sometimes referred to as “cloud computing ” In this model, data centers are consolidated and computer 
infrastructures are employed as a shared service Hosting systems and applications on common infrastructures distributes workload, reduces requirements for computing capacity, and lowers total cost The 
future promises to bring additional enhancements by offering capabilities beyond shared computing, 
such as shared application and shared information services As a result, departments and agencies can 
adopt existing capabilities and focus on developing the services and technologies that best align with 
their mission and expertise In particular, shared capabilities will allow departments and agencies to 
better deliver targeted services to specific end-users, as opposed to trying to serve all classes of users 
with all required capabilities The projected advantages of this approach include streamlined cost and 
efficiency, as well as the opportunity to reduce the number of unique interfaces and required standards.</p>

<h5>3.2 Improve Assured Data, Services, and Network Interoperability</h5>
<p>While the shared service model offers significant enhancements, it does not guarantee interoperability 
or improved information sharing Departments and agencies continue to wrestle with the challenge of 
using legacy data, services and systems that have varying degrees of connectivity across and among 
various classified and unclassified networks IT development often fails to accord sufficient priority 
to interoperability By planning and prioritizing during the design phase of IT solutions, departments 
and agencies can enjoy community-wide benefits of interoperability while meeting individual mission 
mandates Increasing interoperability and access to shared services and information improves mission 
success, minimizes complexity, and reduces duplication as well as ongoing sustainment requirements.</p>

<h5>3.3 Leverage Collective Demand through Acquisition</h5>
<p>An acquisition approach that integrates standards is essential for deploying interoperable technology 
solutions and shared services Our ability to integrate systems and share information is stronger and 
more adaptable when government departments and agencies partner with one another and industry 
to identify and reuse the best solutions already at the government’s disposal and to develop standardsbased technologies that support multiple missions and communities Stakeholders are encouraged 
to work with industry to develop and acquire tools and technologies leveraging information sharing 
and safeguarding standards Federal acquisition policies, including grant policies, should facilitate and 
reward collaboration between departments and agencies resulting in reuse of existing services and 
encouraging development of enterprise-wide acquisition priorities Aligning acquisition requirements
should not only support interoperable technology acquisition, but also should lower incremental costs 
to departments and agencies with fewer acquisitions and reduced processing costs.</p>

<h4>4. Strengthen Information Safeguarding through Structural Reform, Policy, and Technical Solutions</h4>

<h5>4.1 Reform Structures and Policy</h5>
<p>Recent information breaches and disclosures highlight vulnerabilities in the protection of sensitive 
and classified information Continued implementation of structural reform and standardized policies, 
however, will strengthen oversight as well as align security best practices 
The risk of unauthorized disclosure and misuse of information originates from insider threats and external intrusions; structural reforms must address both The ability to safeguard information depends on 
implementing and strengthening policies and procedures that enable network monitoring and detection of anomalous behavior to identify insider threats and intrusions Existing coordination bodies sustain 
the focus on information safeguarding and jointly own responsibility for developing effective technical 
policies and standards for coordinating government-wide implementation, conducting independent 
compliance assessments, and holding senior-level officials accountable Aggregating appropriate 
information from counterintelligence, security, information assurance, and human resource elements, 
across multiple networks and domains, in near-real time, enables the appropriate authorities to proactively reduce and address security breaches Likewise, developing a coordinated enterprise capability 
to monitor the health of our networks and detect malicious access attempts requires a comprehensive 
understanding of how applications and services are used across networks and security domains Policies 
and procedures should also address unintended release of information Prevention, detection, and 
mitigation policies, paired with appropriate supporting technologies, help create the assurance and 
trust among partners to confidently share information.</p>

<h5>4.2 Enhance Data-Level Controls, Automated Monitoring, and Cross-Classification Solutions</h5>
<p>Technology also plays an important role in developing our safeguarding capabilities Progress requires 
we move from network to data-level controls with application interoperability Increasingly granular security controls will improve access to information regardless of where information flows and 
strengthen protection against unauthorized disclosure, dissemination, access, and modification of 
information Automated continuous monitoring, paired with appropriate privacy protections, supports 
shared risk management and enables a near real-time picture of existing or emerging risks 
The focus of information safeguarding efforts in the past was primarily bound to systems and networks 
at specific classification levels Departments and agencies, however, often identify the need to securely 
share information across systems regardless of classification Technologies, capabilities, and services 
such as shared computing further accelerate the need for cross-classification sharing Consequently, we 
need technologies, standards, and common processes to support this critical emerging requirement.</p>

<h4>5. Protect Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties through Consistency and Compliance</h4>

<h5>5.1 Increase Consistent Government-Wide Application of Protections</h5>
<p>Privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections are integral to maintaining the public trust; this is a 
cornerstone of our information sharing and safeguarding efforts Departments and agencies will need 
to adopt a consistent approach to the foundational privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections for 
information they hold, with appropriate provisions for mission-based flexibility in accordance with existing law and policy This leverages governance bodies and existing procedures, to continually refine and 
establish necessary guidelines for appropriate protections of shared information, such as the Information 
Sharing Environment Privacy Guidelines Cultivating a comprehensive and efficient approach to defining 
and implementing privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections in information sharing between 
both Federal and non-Federal partners sustains applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements, 
an imperative for protecting both national security and individual rights.</p>

<h5>5.2 Build Protections into the Development of Information Sharing Operations</h5>
<p>Protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties is not the exclusive domain of legal counsel and subject 
matter experts Legal and policy controls on the use and protection of information may be implemented 
through the policy process and integrated in technology This warrants participation by and coordination 
with program managers, system architects and developers, information assurance personnel, and others 
in program and system design Addressing privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties early in the planning 
of any new initiative (or in the redesign of existing systems and processes) allows these information 
protections to be considered, built-in, managed, and monitored enterprise-wide.</p>

<h5>5.3 Promote Accountability and Compliance Mechanisms</h5>
<p>Ensuring compliance through oversight, performance management, and accountability with proper 
enforcement mechanisms is as critical as identifying the protections themselves Each department and 
agency currently monitors and reports on the rigor of its privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections 
using appropriate compliance documentation and performance management techniques Monitoring 
and measuring compliance verification mechanisms for accountability assists mission partners in 
identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, and in validating they are actively and systematically refining 
protections for individual rights As we transition to an enterprise-wide approach, protections must be 
continuously reinforced and assessed, including monitoring of access and use controls, analysis of audit 
and usage information, and regular and systematic compliance reviews.</p>

<p>Privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties performance and compliance must evolve along with information 
sharing needs and methods Going forward, this enterprise-wide model should include implementing 
technological means of reviewing and enforcing privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections, 
requirements, and policies.</p>
